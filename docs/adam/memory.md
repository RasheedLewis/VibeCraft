# Memory

we're working on the UI for video composition, so first I need to get the UI up and find the 'Compose' button and fix it so it runs the MVP-03 code that stitches together clips+audio (and normalizes first)
do not commit until I tell you to, and when I tell you to commit, first ensure 0 lint-build-test issues
reference MVP_ROADMAP to understand what we're doing (and ARCH for high-level context e.g. data flows)
